Exploring with Semantic Kernel, Ollama, function calling, Agent Framework, etc.

The Program.cs it's used as a "notebook". I will contain whatever my last experiment was.

Note: Started as an experiment with Ollama, but most small Ollama models I tried aren't "smart" enough for many function calling scenarios. I'm mainly using Gemini models. I won't change the repo name :)
